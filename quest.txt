What is a network?
A collection of devices exchanging data

Network components:
Host- computer connected to a network, helps communicate with other hosts in the network (include clients/servers)
Server- host whose software allows them to provide services to other hosts
Client- host that requests services
Server-client architecture - structure that partitions tasks between the provider of a resource (server) and the service requester (client)

Peer-to-peer architecture 
Here the workload is partitioned between peers. Peers are equally privileged and equipotent. Both peers can request from each other.

Intermediary device 
Networking device positioned between a remote access service (RAS) and a RAS client.
- Switches and wireless access points (network access)
- Routers
- Firewalls

Network media
- Metal wired (usually Cu) cable
- Fiber optic (drawing glass/ plastic, diameter is slightly thicker than a human hair)
- Wireless

End device
A source or destination device in a networked system e.g a user's PC.

Network type is based on
- Size of area covered
- Number of users connected
- Type of serices
- Area of responsibility

	- LAN: Local Area Network (house/office)
	- WAN : Wide Area Network (extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking)

Message delivery options
- Unicast: delivered to one destination
- Multicast: delivered to a set of destinations
- Broadcast: delivered to all destinations in a network

Open system Interconnection (OSI) model, framework used to describe the functions of a network system
- Physical layer, electrically transmits raw unstructured data accross the network from the physical layer of the receiving device e.g cables, pins
- Data link, directly connected nodes used to perform node to node data transfer where data is packaged into frames, encompasses Media Access control - controls device interaction
- Network layer - recieves frames from the data link layer and delivers them to their destinations based on the IP addresses - e.g routers, firewall, network interface controller
- Transport layer - manages the delivery and error checking of data packets - Transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol (ports)
- Session layer - conversions between different computers
- Presentation layer - translates date for the application layer based on the syntax an application accepts
- Application layer - the end user and the application layer interact dirrectly with the software application 

TCP/IP presentation, session are considered application
Application layer - osi app, presentation, session
Transport layer - osi transport
Internet layer - osi network
Network access layer - data link layer, physical layer

Layers work together by encapsulation - when data moves from upper layer to lower layer of TCP/IP protocol stack, during an outgoing transmission, each layer includes a bundle of relevant information called "header" along with the actual data.
Decapsulation - each layer takes out info from previous layer.

Port number
Communication end point.
- Identifies a specific process/ type of network service.
- Port numbers are always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport used for communication.
- Source ports and destination ports form a channel

Port numbers
0-65535 (2^16) 16 bits

0-1023: well known ports: reserved for popular services, e.g email
1024-49151: registered ports e.g applications
49152-65535: private/dynamic ports

**TCP 20** : FTP file transfer protocol - data transfer
**TCP 21** : FTP control
**TCP 22** : SSH (secure shell) access port host
**TCP 23** : telnet 
**TCP 80** : HTTP (web) hyper text transfer protocol
TCP 443 HTTPS


hex- A9, dec- (10 x 16^1) + (9 x 16^0) = 169, binary- 1010, 1001
hex- CAB, dec- (12 x 16^2) + (10 x 16^1) + (10 x 16^0) = 3243, binary - 1100, 1010, 1011 

MAC

|OUI     |NIC     |
|Vendor  |Device  |
|02 42 90|c1 b4 8c|
48 bit 12 hexidecimal (6 octets)

**IP address** : A numerical lable assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
**IP** : the internet protocol is a set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet.

|       |Octet 1|Octet 2|Octet 3|Octet 4|
|Class A|1-127  |0-255  |0-255  |0=255  |starts with 0
|Class B|128-191|0-255  |0-255  |0=255  |starts with 10
|Class C|192-223|0-255  |0-255  |0=255  |starts with 110
|Class D|224-239|0-255  |0-255  |0=255  |
|Class E|240-255|0-255  |0-255  |0=255  |

**Subnet Mask**
- 32 bit address
- Used to mask a portion of the IP address to distinguish the network ID from the host ID
	- Calculate the Network ID: convert the IP to binary, calculate the logical AND for the IP address and the Subnet Mask

In the subnet mask:
	-Bits that correspond to the network ID are set to 1
	-Bits that correspond to the host ID are set to 0
	- 1s on left, 0s on right
**Broadcast ID (bcast IP)**
- The last IP in the network
- all hosts bits of the IP address are 1's
- All host in a network should have the same Broadcast IP
- Use the broadcast IP to send specific data to all the machines on the same network

**Localhost- 127.0.0.1**
The standard IP address used for a loopback network connection - looped back to your own machine (this computer)

- Ping is Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet. -at layer 3 (Network)
- Ping allows a user to ping another device IP address, this helps determine whether a device is reachable via the network.

**Broadcast Domain**
A broadcast domain is the region that broadcasts are received, broadcasts are restricted by routers(layer 3 devices)

**ARP & RARP**
Layer 2
Address resolution protocol - maps an IP address to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network MAC
Reverse address resolution protocol
ARP and RARP translate between IP addresses and MAC layer addresses
- They are broadcast protocols
All hosts on a network are located by their IP address, but NICs (layer 2) do not have IP addresses, they have MAC addresses. ARP associated the IP address to a MAC address.

Default Gateway**

The device that handles the traffic between different IP networks, usually the router interface.
Hosts can only send traffic to the gateway if:
- it's connected to its network physically
- it's on the same subnet (usually)

**DHCP**
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - works on bc mode (mac address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) - this uses UDP ports => application layer protocol
Server/ client protocol
- Automatically assigns IP hosts with IP addresses and other IP addresses of devices connected to the network (e.g default gateway)
- Port numbers:
	- 67/udp for DHCP server
	- 68/udp for DHCP client 
-  Eliminates need for individually configuring network devices manually.

**HTTP**
Hypertext Transfer Protocol - an application layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents (graphics, audio, plain text video)
HTML - markup languge for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser
HTTP runs over TCP
TCP port 80
HTTPS (secure)
TCP port 443

**FTP**
File Transfer Protocol - application layer protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.
TCP port 21 - used to establish the connection between 2 hosts
TCP port 20 - used to transfer data 

**DNS**
Domain Name System - converts host names/ domain names into IP addresses, browsers uses these IPs to load internet pages.
DNS is an application layer protocol that uses the transport layer protocol . Uses TCP for zone transfer and UDP for name.

Firewalls
A network security system that monitors/ controls incoming and outgoing network traffic (between networks) - firewalls can be a device or a software.
Access Control List (ACL) - set of rules or policy that grants/denies access to a resource, it filter access to a network.
ACLs usually reside in a firewall router in a router that connects networks.

**Properties of Firewalls**
- Resistent to network attacks.
- Have ACLs
- Can be software installed on a host/ hardware, a computes that enforces ACLs.

**Advantages**
- Prevents hackers and remote access
- Protects data
- Protects privacy details
- Can protect against Trojans - malware often disguised as legitimate software.

**Disadvantages**
- It can't always protect network from attacks from the inside.


**Packet Filtering Firewall**
Based on network, transport layers. Monitors outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination IP address, protocols and ports (TCP/UDP ports)

**Application Gateway Firewall**
More capable than packet filtering firewall.
Operates at the application layer (also checks presentation, session, transport, network layers). This means firewall can check software.

**Firewall zones**
Private(inside)
Public(untrusted)
DMZ - a perimeter network that protects the internal local-area network from untrusted traffic.
- Allows you to access untrusted networks like the internet, whilst ensuring its private network remains secure.


A switch connects devices on a computer network using packet switching to receive/forward data packets - data link layer
A switch is designed to connect computers within a network - data link layer
A router is designed to connect multiple networks together via the switches - network control layer 3

MAC stands for Media Access Control. It is a unique identifier for network interfaces.
